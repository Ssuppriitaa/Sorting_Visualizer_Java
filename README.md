-- -- -- -- -- Sorting Algorithm Visualizer and Comparator -- -- -- -- -- --
is a desktop Java application built with pure Java, focusing on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and OOP principles. It visualizes classic sorting algorithms, animates operations, and compares performance (comparisons, swaps, and runtime) across algorithms.

Technologies Used
    Java (Core + OOP)
    Data Structure & Algorithms

A Java-based console application that visualizes and compares popular sorting algorithms. This tool demonstrates the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms in the terminal and provides performance comparisons including time complexity, steps, and space complexity.

#Features :
    Interactive Visualization: Choose a sorting algorithm to visualize its execution step-by-step in the terminal, including array states after each operation (e.g., swaps, insertions, divisions, merges).
    Algorithm Comparison: Compare all implemented algorithms on the same array, displaying execution time (nanoseconds), operation steps (comparisons/swaps), and space complexity.

#Detailed Insights:
    For Merge Sort: Shows divide-and-conquer divisions, mid-point formula usage (mid = left + (right - left) / 2), and merge steps.
    For Quick Sort: Displays partitioning with pivot selection (last element) and recursive divisions.

Supported Algorithms:
    Bubble Sort (O(n²) time, O(1) space)
    Selection Sort (O(n²) time, O(1) space)
    Insertion Sort (O(n²) time, O(1) space)
    Merge Sort (O(n log n) time, O(n) space)
    Quick Sort (O(n log n) average time, O(log n) space)    

OOP Design: Uses abstract classes for inheritance and polymorphism, adhering to clean code principles. ***No external libraries; uses only standard Java APIs.***   

--- ⚡ Speed Control for slow/medium/fast visualization
---🔁 Array size and data customization

Learning Outcomes:
---Strong understanding of DSA fundamentals
---Practical use of OOP design principles
---Strong understanding of sorting algorithms
---How to write clean OOP-based reusable code
---Algorithm performance analysis
